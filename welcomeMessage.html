<h1>Welcome to CodeIT Suisse 2016!</h1>
<p>
    Gather around as a team and read this!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What to do</strong><br>
    The aim is to create an application together as a team and make as much money as you can, as quick as you can!<br>
    Throughout Saturday, you are free to play with the testing servers however you like. If you run out of money during this test phase, just let us know! -- We are here to help in any way we can!<br>
    On Sunday, you will run your final application and see if you can outsmart the other teams around you!
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Your team</strong><br>
    You team will start off with 1 million in your account that you are free to use how you like.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Where to begin?</strong><br>
    To start, our servers first need to know who you and your team are!<br>
    Spend one or two minutes to think up a team name amongst you and using any method you wish, start by performing an HTTP POST request to the following URL:
    </p><blockquote>http://cis2016-teamtracker.herokuapp.com/api/teams</blockquote>
    Provide any missing information that it may need in <strong>the body as json.</strong><br>
    <strong>When your team is created, please store your secret UID that is generated for your team - you will need this later!</strong>
    <p>
        Once you have this ID, validate your secret team UID by visiting the following URL:
        </p><blockquote>http://cis2016-teamtracker.herokuapp.com/api/teams/validate/{TEAM UID}</blockquote>
        Once this is successful, check the dashboard on the big screens - this should update and show you have completed the first stage! - <strong>Give a loud cheer to show the other teams that you have done it!</strong><br>
        Continue to complete the other stages by following the instructions provided when you successfully validated your team!<br>
        If at any stage, you wish to view the next stage hint, append <strong>'?next_steps'</strong> to any of the endpoints you have gathered over time. Once you have all the endpoints collected, this will not need to be appended.
    <p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>
    On behalf of everyone here, we wish you the very best of luck!<br>

<h5>Remember, reach out to any of us identified by a blue line on our name badges if you encounter any problems or have any questions and we will try our best to help out where we can!</h5>
